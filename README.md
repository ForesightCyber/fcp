# Foresight Cyber Platform
"Find, Correlate and Process" data within your network. 

The Foresight Cyber Platform (FCP) is a platform for gathering and analysing information regarding IT infrastructure within an organization, providing business intelligence features to a sensitive area where cross-referencing information is difficult.
The goal is to be able to audit information within a company, based on information retrieved from multiple tools and stored in the platform database.
The information gathered and processed by the platform is held within the database, for the explicit purpose of providing users with historical trends and a status update at any given point in time.
The platform was developed primarily for our internal Foresight Cyber team: however, it is now available for everybody.
